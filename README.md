Welcome to Fashion Meter, a project dedicated to making AI as stylish as your wardrobe! ðŸ‘—ðŸ‘šðŸ‘ 

This project is an exploration of machine learning in the world of fashion, where we teach a neural network to classify fashion images into distinct styles. Whether you're a Cottagecore enthusiast, a fan of Y2K, or you just love some Academia chic, Fashion Meter can help you identify your next outfit trend with just a glance.

Fashion Meter uses cutting-edge Deep Learning models to analyze fashion images, and based on their content, it predicts which style category the image belongs to.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

**The Workflow**:
-- Data Preprocessing: We start with a raw dataset of fashion images (because raw fashion is the best, right?). The images are carefully organized into categories like Academia, Alt, Cottagecore, and Y2K.
-- Model Training: We feed these images into our custom-trained deep learning model, where it learns to recognize different fashion styles. Each epoch takes the model one step closer to understanding what makes each style unique.
-- Evaluation: After training, we evaluate the modelâ€™s performance and check how well it predicts which category an image belongs to. Spoiler: It does an amazing job at it.
-- Fashion Predictions: With a trained model in hand, you can now upload your favorite fashion images and get them classified into their rightful fashion styles!

**Why You Should Care**:
-- Perfect for fashion enthusiasts: Want to know which style is "hot" this season? This model can help!
-- Great for data science learners: Whether you're just starting out with machine learning or you're deep into the world of neural networks, this project has something to offer.
-- Fun & Practical: Because who doesn't love a bit of fashion AI fun?

**Features:**
-- Custom dataset of fashion images sorted by style.
-- Powerful neural network model that learns to classify images into fashion categories.
-- Integration with Google Colab and WandB for smooth experimentation and visualization.
--Easy-to-understand code and notebooks, ready for you to clone and run on your own.


So, why not give it a try? Dive into the world of Fashion Meter and letâ€™s see if AI can predict the next big trend before anyone else does! ðŸš€

## Steps

Preprocess dataset before training via command:

### Prepare dataset

```shell
python data/raw/test-train.py
```

```sh

python -m fashion_meter_module.dataset process-raw-dataset \
    --input-csv data/raw/train.csv \
    --output-csv data/processed/train.csv
```
```sh

python -m fashion_meter_module.dataset process-raw-dataset \
    --input-csv data/raw/test.csv \
    --output-csv data/processed/test.csv
```

### Start training

```sh
python -m fashion_meter_module.modeling.train \
    --model-path models/custom_model_resnet18.pth \
    --train-csv data/processed/train.csv \
    --root-dir data/processed \
    --batch-size 64 \
    --epochs 15 \
    --learning-rate 0.0005 \
    --wandb-project "resnet18-custom-dataset"
```

### Use benchmarks

```sh
python -m fashion_meter_module.modeling.benchmark 
    --test-csv data/processed/test.csv 
    --root-dir data/processed 
    --batch-size 64 
    --models resnet18,resnet50,resnet101
```
